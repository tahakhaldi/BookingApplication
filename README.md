# MediBook Booking Application

## How to? 
Set up MAMP server to install a local server environment in your own computer. Download a zipped file of this project and then save the extracted folder to any location. Open the MAMP application, go to Preferences, Choose the Web Server Apache and choose the Document Root as the directory where the extracted folder is located for example : ``` C:\Users\YourName\git\BookingApplication ```

Once this is done, click Ok and click on Start Servers which will automatically prompt the start of Apache and MySQL. Now, all you have to do is to open the browser and go to ``` localhost ``` to see the website. 

For the database, make sure to install a database management app like SQLYog to view the content of your database.
